This package provides enhanced WiFi menu and status modules for Linux systems using NetworkManager.

## What Does This Do?

This provides two main components:

1. **wifimenu-podobu** - A WiFi connection menu that works with any launcher (wofi, rofi, etc.)
2. **network-wifi.sh** - A status module to display WiFi connection status (works with polybar or similar)

## Files Included

1. **wifimenu-podobu** - Main WiFi menu script
2. **network-wifi.sh** - WiFi status display script
3. **user_modules.ini** - Module configuration (for polybar users)
4. **README.md** - This file

## Features

### wifimenu-podobu Features

- Network scanning with signal strength indicators
- Saved network detection with indicator icon (󱣪)
- Disconnect by pressing Enter on connected network
- Refresh cooldown (15 seconds) with message
- SSID truncation for long network names (>70 chars)
- **"Try Again" feature** for saved networks with changed passwords (avoids system password dialog)
- Network Information menu with detailed network stats
- Auto Connection toggle to automatically connect to available saved networks
- Network count display on Refresh Networks option
- **Remove All Saved Networks** option in Known Connections (keeps current connection)
- **Back** option in Known Connections menu
- Works with any launcher (wofi, rofi, dmenu, etc.)
- Cherry theme color menu

### How "Try Again" Works (Avoiding System Password Dialog)

When connecting to a saved network where the password has changed, the OS may show a system password dialog (like KDE's). This script handles it gracefully:

1. **First Attempt**: Try to connect to the saved network using nmcli
2. **Detect Failure**: If connection fails (wrong password), the script:
   - Deletes the saved connection from NetworkManager
   - Saves the network name to a pending file (`.pending_network`)
   - Exits with code 42 to restart the menu
3. **Show as Try Again**: The network now appears in the menu with "(Try Again)" suffix
4. **User Re-enters Password**: User selects it and enters the new password
5. **Connect Fresh**: The script connects to the network with the new password and saves it

This way, users don't get stuck at system dialogs - they can re-enter passwords through the menu itself.

### network-wifi.sh Features

- Shows current connection with SSID and download speed
- Different icons based on connection state:
  - **Offline**: 󰖪 + "Offline"
  - **Connected but no internet**: 󰤣 + SSID + speed

---

## Installation (Step by Step for Rookies)

### Step 1: Choose Where to Put Your Scripts

Decide where you want to store your scripts. For this example, we'll use `~/wifi-scripts/`.

Replace `~/YourPath/` in all file paths with your chosen directory (e.g., `~/wifi-scripts/`).

### Step 2: Create the Directory

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/wifi-scripts
```

### Step 3: Copy the Files

Copy the downloaded files to your new directory:
```bash
cp wifimenu-podobu ~/wifi-scripts/
cp network-wifi.sh ~/wifi-scripts/
cp user_modules.ini ~/wifi-scripts/
```

### Step 4: Make Scripts Executable

Run these commands to make the scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/wifi-scripts/wifimenu-podobu
chmod +x ~/wifi-scripts/network-wifi.sh
```

### Step 5: Check if You Have a Launcher

You need a menu launcher to use wifimenu-podobu. Check which one you have:

```bash
# Check for wofi (recommended)
which wofi

# Check for rofi
which rofi

# Check for dmenu
which dmenu
```

If you don't have any, install one. For example:
```bash
# On Arch/Manjaro
sudo pacman -S wofi

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install wofi

# On Fedora
sudo dnf install wofi
```

### Step 6: Test the WiFi Menu

Try running the menu to see if it works:
```bash
~/wifi-scripts/wifimenu-podobu
```

You should see a menu with available networks. Use arrow keys to select, Enter to connect.

### Step 7: Create a Convenience Script (Optional)

Create a script to easily open the menu. Create a file called `wifi-menu`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
~/wifi-scripts/wifimenu-podobu "$@"
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/wifi-scripts/wifi-menu
```

Now you can run it with:
```bash
~/wifi-scripts/wifi-menu
```

### Step 8: Add to Desktop Launcher (Optional)

You can add the WiFi menu to your desktop environment's launcher:
- Copy the `wifi-menu` script to a location in your PATH, or
- Create a .desktop file in `~/.local/share/applications/`

Example .desktop file:
```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=WiFi Menu
Comment=Open WiFi connection menu
Exec=~/wifi-scripts/wifi-menu
Icon=network-wireless
Terminal=false
Type=Application
```

Save this as `~/.local/share/applications/wifi-menu.desktop`

### Step 9: For Polybar Users - Add WiFi Status Bar

If you use polybar and want to see WiFi status in your bar:

1. Copy `user_modules.ini` to your polybar config directory:
   ```bash
   cp ~/wifi-scripts/user_modules.ini ~/.config/polybar/forest/
   ```

2. Open your polybar config (usually `~/.config/polybar/forest/config.ini`)

3. Find the modules section and add `network-wifi`:
   ```
   modules-right = ... network-wifi ...
   ```

4. Update the paths in user_modules.ini to match your script location (replace ~/YourPath/scripts/ with ~/wifi-scripts/)

5. Restart polybar:
   ```bash
   polybar kill
   polybar &
   ```

### Step 10: Test Everything

- Test the WiFi menu by running it
- Try connecting to a network
- Test the Auto Connection feature
- If using polybar, check that the status shows correctly

## Customization Guide

### Changing Script Locations

If you move the scripts to a different location, you need to update:

1. **wifimenu-podobu**: Uses `SDIR="$(dirname "$0")"` to find its own location. All file references are relative to where the script is.

2. **network-wifi.sh** (line 5): Change the speed file location:
   ```bash
   # Default:
   SPEED_FILE="$HOME/.cache/wifi-speed.data"
   
   # Change to your path:
   SPEED_FILE="~/YourPath/wifi-speed.data"
   ```

3. **user_modules.ini**: Update all paths:
   - `exec` - path to network-wifi.sh
   - `label` - path to wifimenu.sh (in the click area)
   - `click-left` - path to wifimenu.sh

### Changing Default Launcher

By default, wifimenu-podobu uses wofi. To change to another launcher:

Edit wifimenu-podobu and find line ~1131 (around "launcher='wofi'"), change it:
```bash
# For rofi:
launcher='rofi'

# For dmenu:
launcher='dmenu'

# For wmenu:
launcher='wmenu'

# For bemenu:
launcher='bemenu'
```

### Key Directory References

| File | Line | Description | Default | Change To |
|------|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| wifimenu-podobu | ~ (SDIR) | Log, pending network, refresh time, auto connect files | Script directory | `$HOME/YourPath/scripts` |
| network-wifi.sh | 5 | Speed data file | `$HOME/.cache/wifi-speed.data` | `~/YourPath/wifi-speed.data` |
| user_modules.ini | 7 | Script path | `~/YourPath/scripts/network-wifi.sh` | Your actual path |
| user_modules.ini | 15-16 | Menu wrapper path | `~/YourPath/scripts/wifimenu.sh` | Your actual path |

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi menu doesn't open
- Check that the path is correct
- Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x wifimenu-podobu`
- Make sure you have a launcher installed (wofi, rofi, etc.)

### Networks not showing
- Make sure WiFi is enabled: `nmcli radio wifi on`
- Check that nmcli is working: `nmcli device wifi list`

### Icons not showing
- Install Nerd Fonts
- Make sure your terminal uses a Nerd Font

### Auto Connection not working
- Check that the `.auto_connect` file is being created in the script directory

### Connection hangs or shows system password dialog
- This is handled by the "Try Again" feature - the network will appear with "(Try Again)" and you can re-enter the password
